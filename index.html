  <details open>
    <summary> What is a stablecoin?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p class="faq">From Wikipedia: Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize the volatility of the price of the stablecoin, relative to some "stable" asset or basket of assets. A stablecoin can be pegged to a cryptocurrency, fiat money, or to exchange-traded commodities (such as precious metals or industrial metals). For ZARP this means being pegged to the South African Rand, so that the price of 1 ZARP always equals 1 South African Rand.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Where does the name ‚ÄòZARP‚Äô come from?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p class="faq">‚ÄòZAR‚Äô is the ticker symbol for the South African Rand currency. The ‚ÄòZA‚Äô is often used to describe South Africa, for example in the country‚Äôs .co.za internet domain names, and refers to the name Zuid-Afrika. The ‚ÄòP‚Äô stands for peg, because ZARP is pegged to the price of the South African Rand. </p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What is a "true" stablecoin?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p class="faq">A true stablecoin is backed by a validated treasury of currency in reserve, which guarantees the value of the coin. ZARP is the only true stablecoin for the South African Rand. We have bank-approval for our treasury reserves, which are independantly audited by Kempen Audit with comprehensive attestation reports.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do you guarantee the price of ZARP?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p class="faq">Whenever our Minting Partners buy ZARP from us, we create new tokens to match the amount of ZARP being acquired. These rands are kept safely in our treasury until a partner wants to withdraw real rands from us, at which point we burn (destroy) their ZARP tokens, and send actual rands to their bank account. Our treasury is verified by independent auditors to guarantee that we actually have the money we claim to and are acting honestly in maintaining our treasury. This way there is always at least 1 South African Rand for every 1 ZARP token, and we will never pay more or less than R1 for every ZARP minted or burned with us. Simple ‚ú®</p>

  <details>
    <summary>Who can use ZARP?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p class="faq">Anyone who can get hold of it! But for now only our Minting Partners are allowed to mint and burn tokens directly with us.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What exchanges currently list ZARP?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p class="faq">ZARP is currently only available on Quickswap as we test before launching the token to a wider audience. We are working with some of the leading exchanges in the market to list ZARP. Watch this space! If you‚Äôd like to help out, contact your favorite exchange and ask them to list ZARP, or if you represent an exchange that would like to list ZARP (good idea) please <a href="mailto:hi@zarp.cash">drop us a mail.</a></p>

  <details>
    <summary>What blockchain does ZARP run on?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p class="faq">ZARP is built on the Ethereum blockchain, using the ERC20 token standard. It is also available on the Polygon (Matic) network. We chose Ethereum because it is:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Battle-tested and secure.</li>
        <li>Improving in scalability thanks to the Ethereum 2.0 ‚ÄòSerenity‚Äô upgrade and the move to Proof of Stake.</li>
        <li>Widely supported and understood.</li>
        <li>Extensible and enabling of smart contract functionality.</li>
        <li>Easy for Exchange Partners to integrate.</li>
        <li>Compatible with a large number of wallets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="faq">We are also open to taking ZARP onto additional blockchains, but have no plans to do so at present.</a></p>
